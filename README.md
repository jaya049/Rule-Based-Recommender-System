# Rule-Based-Recommender-System
Recommender System Machine Learning Project - Design, implement and train a rule-based recommender system in Python
In a Rule Based sysstem we create the rules, so we know exactly which recommendation is made for which choice.
I used  a dataset of movies with their genres. Did data loading, manipulation, and implementing conditional logic in Python to recommend a number of film recommendations from each selected genres.
Collected movie dataset from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/. This dataset contains movie IDs, titles, and genres. The movies.csv file is what I used for creating rules.
Used pandas for data manipulation.
Rule : If the user likes 'Action' movies, recommend 'Action' movies
